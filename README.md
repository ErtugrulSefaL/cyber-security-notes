# Cybersecurity Notes

This repository contains my **public cybersecurity notes and resources**.
The content is built from my personal learning process and focuses on
**fundamental concepts, tools, defensive techniques, and references**.

The goal is to create a **clear, structured, and practical knowledge base**
that can be useful both for myself and for others learning cybersecurity.
