# OSI(Open Systems Interconnection) Model


> [!INFO] OSI
> The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual model developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that describes how communications should occur in a computer network. In other words, the OSI model defines a framework for computer network communications. Although this model is theoretical, it is vital to learn and understand as it helps grasp networking concepts on a deeper level. 


The OSI model is composed of seven layers:

| Layer Number | Layer Name         | Main Function                                         | Example Protocols and Standards           |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Layer 7      | Application layer  | Providing services and interfaces to applications     | HTTP, FTP, DNS, POP3, SMTP, IMAP          |
| Layer 6      | Presentation layer | Data encoding, encryption, and compression            | Unicode, MIME, JPEG, PNG, MPEG            |
| Layer 5      | Session layer      | Establishing, maintaining, and synchronising sessions | NFS, RPC                                  |
| Layer 4      | Transport layer    | End-to-end communication and data segmentation        | UDP, TCP                                  |
| Layer 3      | Network layer      | Logical addressing and routing between networks       | IP, ICMP, IPSec                           |
| Layer 2      | Data link layer    | Reliable data transfer between adjacent nodes         | Ethernet (802.3), WiFi (802.11)           |
| Layer 1      | Physical layer     | Physical data transmission media                      | Electrical, optical, and wireless signals |

# TCP/IP Model

TCP /IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and was developed in the 1970s by the Department of Defense (DoD). I hear you ask why DoD would create such a model. One of the strengths of this model is that it allows a network to continue to function as parts of it are out of service, for instance, due to a military attack. This capability is possible in part due to the design of the routing protocols to adapt as the network topology changes.

In our presentation of the ISO OSI model, we went from bottom to top, from layer 1 to layer 7. In this task, let’s look at things from a different perspective, from top to bottom. From top to bottom, we have:

- **Application Layer**: The OSI model application, presentation and session layers, i.e., layers 5, 6, and 7, are grouped into the application layer in the TCP /IP model.
- **Transport Layer**: This is layer 4.
- **Internet Layer**: This is layer 3. The OSI model’s network layer is called the Internet layer in the TCP /IP model.
- **Link Layer**: This is layer 2.

The table below shows how the TCP /IP model layers map to the ISO/OSI model layers.

| Layer Number | ISO OSI Model      | TCP /IP Model (RFC 1122)                                                                                       | Protocols                                        |

# UDP and TCP

The IP protocol allows us to reach a destination host on the network; the host is identified by its IP address. We need protocols that would enable processes on networked hosts to communicate with each other. There are two transport protocols to achieve that: UDP and TCP.

### UDP

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) allows us to reach a specific process on this target host. UDP is a simple connectionless protocol that operates at the transport layer, i.e., layer 4. Being connectionless means that it does not need to establish a connection. UDP does not even provide a mechanism to know that the packet has been delivered.

An IP address identifies the host; we need a mechanism to determine the sending and receiving process. This can be achieved by using port numbers. A port number uses two octets; consequently, it ranges between 1 and 65535; port 0 is reserved. (The number 65535 is calculated by the expression 216 − 1.)

A real-life example similar to UDP is the standard mail service, with no delivery confirmation. In other words, there is no guarantee that the UDP packet has been received successfully, similar to the case of sending a parcel using standard mail with no confirmation of delivery. In the case of standard mail, it means a cheaper cost than the mail delivery options with confirmation. In the case of UDP, it means better speed than a transport protocol that provides “confirmation.”

But what if we want a transport protocol that acknowledges received packets? The answer lies in using TCP instead of UDP.

### TCP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented transport protocol. It uses various mechanisms to ensure reliable data delivery sent by the different processes on the networked hosts. Like UDP, it is a layer 4 protocol. Being connection-oriented, it requires the establishment of a TCP connection before any data can be sent.

In TCP, each data octet has a sequence number; this makes it easy for the receiver to identify lost or duplicated packets. The receiver, on the other hand, acknowledges the reception of data with an acknowledgement number specifying the last received octet.

A TCP connection is established using what’s called a three-way handshake. Two flags are used: SYN (Synchronise) and ACK (Acknowledgment). The packets are sent as follows:

1. SYN Packet: The client initiates the connection by sending a SYN packet to the server. This packet contains the client’s randomly chosen initial sequence number.
2. SYN-ACK Packet: The server responds to the SYN packet with a SYN-ACK packet, which adds the initial sequence number randomly chosen by the server.
3. ACK Packet: The three-way handshake is completed as the client sends an ACK packet to acknowledge the reception of the SYN-ACK packet.
