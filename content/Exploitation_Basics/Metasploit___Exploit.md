# Metasploit___Exploit

As the name suggests, Metasploit is an exploitation framework. Exploits are the most populated module category.

- Most of the exploits will have a preset default payload. However, we can always use the `show payloads` command to list other commands we can use with that specific exploit.
- Once we have decided on the payload, we can use the `set payload` command to make our choice.
- After setting the payload, we use `show options` to see if we need new parameters.
