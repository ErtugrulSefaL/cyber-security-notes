# Digital_Forensics_Fundamentals

Forensics is the application of methods and procedures to investigate and solve crimes. The branch of forensics that investigates cyber crimes is known as **digital forensics**. **Cyber crime** is any criminal activity conducted on or using a digital device. Several tools and techniques are used to investigate digital devices thoroughly after any crime to find and analyze evidence for necessary legal action.

The digital forensics team has various cases requiring different tools and techniques. However, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines a general process for every case. The NIST works on defining frameworks for different areas of technology, including cyber security, where they introduce the process of digital forensics in four phases.

1. **Collection:** The first phase of digital forensics is data collection. Identifying all the devices from which the data can be collected is essential. Usually, an investigator can find personal computers, laptops, digital cameras, USBs, etc., on the crime scene. It is also necessary to ensure the original data is not tampered with while collecting the evidence and to maintain a proper document containing the collected items’ details. We will also be discussing the evidence-acquisition procedures in the upcoming tasks.
2. **Examination:** The collected data may overwhelm investigators due to its size. This data usually needs to be filtered, and the data of interest needs to be extracted. For example, as an investigator, you collected all the media files from a digital camera on the crime scene. You may only require some of the media as you are concerned with the media recorded on a specific date and time. So, in the examination phase, you would filter the media files of the required time and move them to the next phase. Similarly, you may only need the data of a specific user from a system containing numerous user accounts. The examination phase helps you filter this particular data for analysis.
3. **Analysis:** This is a critical phase. The investigators now have to analyze the data by correlating it with multiple pieces of evidence to draw conclusions. The analysis depends upon the case scenario and available data. The analysis aims to extract the activities relevant to the case chronologically.
4. **Reporting:** In the last phase of digital forensics, a detailed report is prepared. This report contains the investigation’s methodology and detailed findings from the collected evidence. It may also contain recommendations. This report is presented to law enforcement and executive management. It is important to include executive summaries as part of the report, considering the level of understanding of all the receiving parties.
