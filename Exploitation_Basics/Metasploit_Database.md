# Metasploit_Database

An actual penetration testing engagement will likely have several targets.
Metasploit has a database function to simplify project management and avoid possible confusion when setting up parameter values.

## How can we initialize Metasploit Database

- We will first need to start the PostgreSQL database, which Metasploit will use with the following command: `systemctl start postgresql`
- Then we will need to initialize the Metasploit Database using the `msfdb init` command. 
	- However, trying to run `msfdb init` as root will give the following error message, "Please run msfdb as a non-root user." This can be solved by running it as the `postgres` account using `sudo -u postgres msfdb init`.
- Now we can check the database status using `db_status` in `msfconsole`

**Different from regular Metasploit usage, once Metasploit is launched with a database, the `help` command, you will show the Database Backends Commands menu.**

### Workspaces 
The database feature will allow you to create workspaces to isolate different projects. When first launched, you should be in the default workspace. You can list available workspaces using the `workspace` command.
